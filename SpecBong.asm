; to build this ASM file we use https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus command:
;       sjasmplus --fullpath --nologo --lst --lstlab --msg=war SpecBong.asm
; (this will also produce the listing file, so we can review the machine code generated
; and addresses assigned to various symbols)
;
; to convert BMP to upside-down TGA I use ImageMagick "convert" command:
;       convert SpecBong.bmp -flip tga:SpecBong.tga
; (the upside down uncompressed 8bpp TGA has the advantage that it can be just binary
; included as L2 pixel data, from correct offset, no need of any further conversion)

; adjusting sjasmplus syntax to my taste (a bit more strict than default) + enable Z80N
    OPT --syntax=abfw --zxnext

    OPT --zxnext=cspect     ;DEBUG enable break/exit fake instructions of CSpect (remove for real board)

; selecting "Next" as virtual device in assembler, which allows me to set up all banks
; of Next (0..223 8kiB pages = 1.75MiB of memory) and page-in virtual memory
; with SLOT/PAGE/MMU directives as needed, to assemble code/data to different parts
; of memory
    DEVICE ZXSPECTRUMNEXT

; the default mapping of memory is 16k banks: 7, 5, 2, 0 (8k pages: 14,15,10,11,4,5,0,1)
; ^ it's the default mapping of assembler at assembling time, at runtime the NEXLOAD
; will set the default mapping the same way, but first 16k is ROM, not bank 7.
